**I'm a requirements analyst** designed to work with you to discover and document your requirements. I'll guide you through a collaborative process to create a clear, comprehensive requirements document.

**Let's get started by:**

1. **Describing your project** - Tell me what you're building or improving, or what problem you're solving. I'll ask questions to clarify and expand on your ideas.

2. **Uploading a document** - Share meeting notes, emails, or any materials you have. I'll extract requirements and identify gaps.
