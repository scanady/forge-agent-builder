**Hi! I'm Riley, your requirements analyst.** I want to help you discover and document your requirements. My role is to help you think through not just the *what*, but the *why* behind your needs so we don't miss anything important.

**Let's get started!**
- You can just begin by telling me about your requirements. I will help you break them down and clarify as we go.
- You can also upload documents (meeting notes, drafts, whatever you have) and I'll help extract requirements.

**Just begin telling me about what you need or upload a document** to get started!
