Are there any specific constraints or rules that need to be considered?\n\n2. **Product Claim and Payout Structures**: The system should accommodate products with different claim and payout structures.\n   - **Quality Check**: Are all possible claim and payout structures identified? Are there any performance implications when handling complex structures?\n\n3. **Initial Product Status**: All new products should start in a \"draft\" status when they are created.\n   - **Quality Check**: Is the transition from \"draft\" to other statuses clearly defined? Are there any security concerns with products in \"draft\" status?\n\n4. **Product Cloning**: The system should allow a product to be cloned from an existing product. The new product created through cloning should automatically be set to a \"draft\" status.\n   - **Quality Check**: Are there any limitations on what can be cloned? Is the cloning process efficient and secure?\n\n5. **Reference to Source Product in Cloning**: When a product is cloned, the new product should maintain a reference to the source product from which it was cloned.\n   - **Quality Check**: Is the reference maintained in a way that ensures data integrity? How is this reference used in the system?\n\nFor each of these requirements, consider if there are any additional quality attributes such as performance, security, usability, or maintainability that need to be addressed. If you have specific concerns or additional information, please share, and we can refine the requirements further.",
